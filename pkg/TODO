- Need:
  + pStudent()
  + dStudent()
  + rStudent()
  + fitStudent()
- Should also work with d = 1 + with missing data
- rename 'a' and 'b' to 'lower' and 'upper'; 'nu' to 'df'
- first arg should be 'upper' with default lower being '-Inf,...'
- R should be 'sigma' and we need a 'standardized = FALSE' argument;
  if standardized = TRUE, loc = 0 and sigma = correlation matrix is assumed
- there should be 'loc' (location vector) with default rep(0, d)
- 'swap' needs to be improved
- 'func' not needed if 'base case' in pstudent() is part of the loop
  (only one call necessary then, so can be omitted)
- more intuitive names for arguments concerning tolerance(s)
- After next 'qrng release', remove ./src/sobol.c/.h => is in qrng
